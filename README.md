# OverTheWire: Bandit Solutions

This repository contains my notes and solutions for the **[OverTheWire Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)** wargame.  
Bandit is a Linux-based challenge designed to teach fundamental command-line skills such as navigating the filesystem, handling permissions, searching for files, and working with SSH.

## About
This repository is a learning journal, not an official solution guide.  
I created it to track my progress, reinforce concepts, and share how I approached each challenge.
