# Level 8

### Goal: The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth

## Solution: 
1. I used the command ```grep "millionth" data.txt``` to view the lines of text in the file ```data.txt``` that have the word millionth in them.
2. The password was next to millionth so I used it to log into user bandit8 using ```ssh```.
   
## Thought Process:
- For this task I used the manual for ```grep``` to understand it's syntax.
