## Goal: Log into the game using SSH

### SSH Information:

Host: bandit.labs.overthewire.org<br>
Port: 2220

## Solution:
1. Used ```ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org``` to log into the user.

## Thought Process:
- ```ssh``` command is the command which is used to enter an SSH.
- ```-p``` used as it is used to input a port after it, ```2220``` being the port.
- ```bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org``` was used as the format is username@host
