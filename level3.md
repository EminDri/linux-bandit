# Level 3

### Goal: The password for the next level is stored in a file called 'spaces in this filename' located in the home directory

## Solution: 
1. Use ```bash cat "spaces in this file name"```.

## Thought Process:
- If I use ```bash cat spaces in the filename``` it will take each word as a separate argument due to the spaces, so I used quotation marks.
