# Level 2

### Goal: The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory

## Solution: 
1. Use ```cat ./-``` to view the lines of text in the - file.
2. Then use this code to log into bandit3 using ```ssh```.

## Thought Process:
- If I use ```cat -``` it will wait for an input after it so it can view that input, so I used ```./``` to escape it.
